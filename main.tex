\title{Holistic Specifications for Robustness}
\subtitle{Zeroth Paper; the complete, long version}




\begin{abstract}
TODO

%Functional specifications of program components describe what
%components \emph{can} do --- the \emph{sufficient} conditions to
%invoke the component's behaviour: a client who supplies arguments
%meeting an operation's preconditions can invoke that operation. While
%functional specifications are enough to reason about the behaviour of
%complete, correct programs, they cannot support reasoning about
%nonfunctional (systemic) behaviours of partial programs in an open
%world where security, privacy, robustness, and reliability are as
%important as functional behaviours. \emph{Necessary specifications}
%--- as their name implies --- describe the \emph{necessary}
%conditions under which a behaviour can take place: constraining
%components' behaviours and defining what they \emph{cannot} do.  By
%complementing functional specifications with necessary specifications,
%programmers can explicitly define what their programs should not do
%(as well as what they should do) making it easier to write components
%that support security and privacy, and so supporting the construction
%of robust and reliable programs.

%% especially in an open world

\note{We need to make a better connection with work on safety. And why it is not sufficient.}

%% We argue  that it is essential to specify policies which make a program robust,
%% and that the specification of what such robustness policies goes beyond  traditional function pre- and post-conditions.
%We propose new fundamental object-capability-inspired assertions
%which describe access and change, and combine these with space and time considersations
%(footprints temporal logic).
%Thus we obtain a logic which reflects not only over the current state, but
%also over the complete trace of an execution.

\section{Introduction}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sect:mitave:DOM} 
motivates our work in terms of an example. Sections~\ref{sect:LangOO}-\ref{sect:assertions} contain a formal definition of of \LangOO, and the semantics of assertions. Section ... related work .... Section xxxx concludes.

THE rest
\include{rest}

\subsection*{LATEX mysteries and terminology}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item
 How can we make the references refer to the Definitions, Lemmas etc
 rather than the section where these appear?
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX:   Not sure what the problem is. I've put labels
   in the definitions and I can use refs to get definition
   numbers~\ref{defONE} and~\ref{def:syntax:classes} ---
   not ~\ref{secONE} and ~\ref{sec:syntax:classes}, the section
   numbers containing those definions.

   Alternatively there is the ``cleveref'' package
   \url{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref/cleveref.pdf}
   where a ``\verb+\cref{foo}+'' can generate both the type and the
   numbner e.g.  ``Definition 3''.
 \end{quotation}

 \item
 Need a nice metavariable for set of addresses, currently it is $R$. Perhaps instead use an enumeration, as eg $\{ \ \alpha_1,...\alpha_n\ \} $
 or $\kappa$?

 \begin{quotation}
 \color{orange} KJX: Hmm, the enumeration is fine. Otherwise $A$?
 $\mathcal{A}$?  Or we could call that set a ``footprint'' and so go
 with $F$ or $\mathcal{F}$\ldots
 \end{quotation}
\item
Find a nice term  to refer to module pairs  (internal, external), and a term for
our version visible states semantics.
 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: ``modules'' and ``modular state semantics''.
   Going to ``modules'' only makes sense with my answer below.
   Other permutations of
   ``visible module/modular state semantics'' work also work:
     modular visible state; visible modular state; etc\ldots
 \end{quotation}


\item
Better symbols for module linking (currently a $\M\link\M'$), and
for module pairing (currently a $\M\mkpair \M'$) -- perhaps there should not be such an operator, as
it does not create a new module, it is only used in execution ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma \leadsto \sigma'$)
and in satisfaction of assertions ($\M\mkpair \M', \sigma\models \A$).
\footnote{\toby{TM: I like~$\M \mkpair \M'$ as it suggests the asymmetry of the visible
    state semantics wrt~$\M$ and~$\M'$.}}

 \begin{quotation}
   \color{orange} KJX: I'm so used to $\M\link\M'$ that I can't think
   of an alternative --- or do I recall we used $\M * \M'$ as a
   separating conjunction?

   So I really liked $\M\mkpair \M'$ --- except then I though that I
   couldn't remember which was the module (inside) and which the
   anti-module (the outside).  For some reason I thought outside would
   go first.  Then I realised, it's easy, cos $\M$ is always the
   module, and $\M'$ is the antimodule.

   At which point I though: OK so let's just write $\M$ as the module,
   and given any $\M$, then $\M'$ (or $\overline{\M}$ or I guess
   \textbf{out}($\M$)) for the antimodule.

   The only thing I think this loses is that the $\M\mkpair \M'$
   syntax, also like a seperating conjunction, is sort of
   self-framing: $\M\mkpair \M'$ encompasses the universe of modules.
   Whereas the other way around, we'd need a (implicit) universe of
   all modules $\mathcal{U}$, and then define $\M' \triangleq
   \mathcal{U} - \M$  If we went with $\M'$ then Sophia couldn't use
   $\M''$ and friends --- have to write \texttt{N} and \texttt{O} for other
   modules?

   I think the only change I could see in the whole document was that
   lemma~\ref{lemma:module_pair_execution} is subsumed into
   lemma~\ref{lemma:linking:properties}.
