Here we desxcribe possible tasks that Matthew could
undertake in Coq, when he is more knowledgeable in Coq.

1) add more counterexamples -- there many versions of Safe
   which do not satisfy the spec.

2) Prove more lemmas about Loo. Eg only connectivity begets 
   connectivity  (but check whether they have been proven)

3) Extend the programming language Loo. Eg add loops, or, more
   ambitious, add exceptions

4) Formuate and prove a lemma that relates assertions that are
   not reeeetricted to foorptints to assertions that are.
   Eg for any asertion A
       B --> A      implies forall S. [ B in S --> A ]
   or something in that style
