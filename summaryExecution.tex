As was have already seen, \Chainmail assertions not only talk about the contents of the current state (stack frame and heap),
but they also talk about future and past states, Therefore, the meaning to \Chainmail assertions depends on the underlying programming
language. In this section, we outline a minimal such language, which we call  \LangOO. Full definitions appear in Appendix \ref{app:LangOO}. \sophia{TODO-say which features need to be in such a language and say that \LangOO is an example of such one.}

Central to our work is the concept of \emph{module}, which is a repository of code. Modules map class identifiers to class definitions, \appref{defONE}, and class definitions consist of method declarations and field declarations, \appref{def:syntax:classes}
